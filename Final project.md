Steps used to analyze data:
--
We downloaded the SAT data from the DCPS website and cleaned it to create a consistent dataset of schools that had reported scores across the decade. After standardizing the values, we uploaded the cleaned data into Datawrapper and built three charts to guide our analysis. One chart compared average SAT scores across high schools, another visualized the relationship between ward-level income and school performance, and the third mapped the scores geographically across D.C. Using these linked visualizations allowed us to quickly spot trends, compare patterns across neighborhoods, and better understand how income levels may be connected to differences in SAT achievement. 

Data Findings/Nut graf: 
--
We wanted to answer the question of whether income has an impact on student SAT scores at DC public high schools. We found data on median household income in each of DC’s eight wards, and we also found data for SAT scores from each DC Public high school.

Future Plans: 
--
To do further reporting on this story, I would want to do three things.
Interview educators/administrators around DC about why they think scores at their respective school is at the level it is.
Get information on how schools with lower test scores plan to turn things around.
Speak with the students to understand their experience with SAT preparation, access to resources, and challenges they face inside and outside the classroom.
