**Article Chosen: "Bleeding Out: Trauma deserts in rural America: Where you live can determine whether you live"**

Lede
--
An anecdote was used in the lede of this story. I believe that this lede was extremely effective. It was a dramatic start to the story that really drew me in and made me want to read more.

The data
--
In this story data about medical centers and medical episodes was most of what was analyzed. There were maps showing how far away a trauma center is from any address in the United States, as well as maps showing whether death happens more frequently in or out of a hospital in a certain area. The data analysis found that rural areas are much more susceptible to death because of how few resources there are close to them. One question that I was left with was what makes a hospital a "trauma" hospital? I ask this because looking at the map there are hospital and medical centers in rural areas of Indiana that I have seen plenty of times that are not marked on the map.

Sources
--
In this story, many human sources were used. The reporter had input from medical professionals, first responders, and authors of studies she used in her research for the story. They seemed to all agree with the her findings in the data. They all shared some personal experiences that backed up the reporter's claims and supported her story.

Story Structure
--
This story uses a martini glass structure and a circle structure. It uses that martini glass structure because it has many different sections with headers that dive into different findings of the data. The circle structure is used with the anecdote at the beginning about a man who crashed off a cliff, and the ending also talking about the same incident with a medical person.

Numbers
--
The story was written very well in terms of how the reporter used numbers. At no point while reading the article did I ever get confused about what any numbers meant or why they were there. I think the reporter did a good job with explaining the data and why it was relevant. For example, when she broke down how many Americans lived over 30 minutes away from a trauma center, she explained why that mattered and how it causes problems.

Data Visualization
--
I think the data visualization in this story was exceptional. It made the story interactive very close to the beginning of it, and kept me engaged and wanting to continue reading. I think the amount of data visualization used in the story was just right because it showed her main points she was trying to make without making the reader feel like we were only seeing maps. 

Methods
--
The authir did not really address any limitations of the data, it seemed like she got all of the data that she thought was necessary. There is a nerd box at the end of the story diving into the reporter's process and the amount of time and effort that went into the story. I think the nerd box was helpful because it added credibility to her work and showed the reader how much work went into putting the story together.

Etc/Other Things
--
One other thing that I wanted to note was the very beginning. When you click the link to open the story, it shows you a picture of rural Colorado that takes up the whole screen and sets the scene for where the story goes in the lede. I thought that was a creative and successful way to get the reader engaged.
