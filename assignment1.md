[Link to story](https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/lawless/2019/05/16/lawless-one-in-three-alaska-villages-have-no-local-police/)

## Clarity and Accuracy
- **Clarity of message:** 5/5  
  - The reporter conveyed that there is a lack of policing in certain areas of Alaska, negatively affecting residents.  
  - The headline makes it clear what the article will be about.  

- **Data visualization:** 5/5  
  - The visualization (locations of areas without law enforcement) was easy to understand.  
  - The article would be improved by including **more graphics**, since only one was used.  

- **Accuracy of data:** 4.5/5  
  - Most data appeared accurate and well-sourced (regional and state-run organizations).  
  - The only questionable point was the reported number of crimes in underpoliced areas, as fewer officers and reporters could affect accuracy.  
  - A full solution would require on-the-ground collection from each village.  

- **Explanation of data:**  
  - The reporter explained what the data meant, why it mattered to local residents, and how it compared to other areas.

- **Overall rating:** 4/5  
- Strengths:  
  - Wide range of relevant data collected.  
  - Content was accessible to the average reader.  
- Room for improvement:  
  - More data should be presented in **graphics** rather than text.

## Type and Color
- **Type:** 4/5  
  - Standard news font, plain black text.  
  - While not unique, it conveyed information clearly.  

- **Color:** 3/5  
  - Minimal use of color beyond images.  
  - Still functional, as heavy use of color wasn’t necessary for the story.  

---

## Creativity
- Plenty of pictures were included, though the first appeared late in the article.  
- Some images were effective, while others felt like fillers.  

**Creativity rating:** 3.5/5


# Pitch for Final Project

My idea for a final project is to do a data-driven story about the financial burden of youth baseball programs. I could get data from local little leagues, and also from travel baseball programs, and compare those two differing systems. This story is timely now because travel baseball is increasingly expensive and recreational little leagues are dying. I could talk to officials at local little leagues and travel programs to get data, but also talk to players who have been in either system to share their experiences with them.

## Note about AI usage in this assignment

I used chatGPT throughout this assignment to help me correctly format the text in markdown language, including headers and bullet points.
