# Critique of *“Lawless: One in three Alaska villages have no local police”*

## Clarity and Accuracy
- **Clarity of message:** 5/5  
  - The reporter conveyed that there is a lack of policing in certain areas of Alaska, negatively affecting residents.  
  - The headline makes it clear what the article will be about.  

- **Data visualization:** 5/5  
  - The visualization (locations of areas without law enforcement) was easy to understand.  
  - The article would be improved by including **more graphics**, since only one was used.  

- **Accuracy of data:** 4.5/5  
  - Most data appeared accurate and well-sourced (regional and state-run organizations).  
  - The only questionable point was the reported number of crimes in underpoliced areas, as fewer officers and reporters could affect accuracy.  
  - A full solution would require on-the-ground collection from each village.  

- **Explanation of data:**  
  - The reporter explained what the data meant, why it mattered to local residents, and how it compared to other areas.
